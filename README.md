A very fast development to organize Google's April Fools Day Suprise

April Fools came early in the form of a Google releasing Pokemon spread across the world in Google Maps for mobile devices. 
A fellow programmer and I took it as an opportunity to quickyly develop a clean interface for tracking the pokemon as 
well as for others to find the ones they're missing. 

Using AngularJS and Bootstrap 3 as a front end and PHP/SQL for a backend. 

Viewable live at http://pokemap.info 

The interface provides for a user to add missing pokemon as they find them, as well as up to 5 locations for each pokemon
if they find themselves unsatisfied with the other locations.

When using on mobile, clicking a link will launch the Google Maps application at a close location to the pokemon being 
caught.

The app was designed for mobile use from the ground up.
